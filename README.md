<p>
Hello, I'm Dominic. I am a computer science major, tech nerd, and avid gamer. <br>
I believe that we can apply both our logical and creative thinking in software development.<br>
Programming, to me, is more than just a skillâ€”it's a personalized expression of creativity and character.<br> 
I strive to practice this in my own development to find the intersections of technology and art.<br>
</p>

Some interests and hobbies I have are: 
* Game Development 
* Pixel Art
* PC Building
* Mechanical Keyboards
